# Projinda-script
## Description
A lifecycle simulation with grass, prey and predators. Prey runs from predators, eats grass and procreate. Predators hunts/eats prey and procreate. Grass grows and gets eaten. Prey can die i two ways, from age or from predation. Predators can only die from age.


## Getting started

The simulation is ran using Git Pages. No setup needed, just click the link below and the simulation will launch.

## Using the simulation

Befor the actual simulation runs parameters needs to be set. A prompt will automaticly appear when launching the page. This can be used to balance the simulation to make it run for as long as possible. When the actual sim is running the user can speed up/slow down the simulation, pause it or reset it. All this is done using buttons on the page, these are placed just under the simulation window. Just under these there are counters to keep track of whats happening in the simulation. 

## Workload

In order to maximize efficiency and minimize git conflicts the workload has been split as follows.
